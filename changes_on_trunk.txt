This document is a changelog "since the last release on PyPI"

 * FileRuleGetter now reloads the rules file on every request if Deliverance is initialized
   with debug=true.

 * If the content document declares an XHTML doctype, then the output will be valid XML. (#28)

 * If the content document declares any doctype, that doctype will be preserved in the output.
   Otherwise, the theme's doctype will be used if present. If neither document has a doctype,
   the default is HTML 4.0 Transitional. (#28)

 * rule_uri can now be a file:// URI

 * You can now set execute_pyref=true in Paste Deploy .ini file to allow pyrefs in the rules when
   using the Deliverance middleware directly. 

 * Fixed "join_attributes tries to join on list and set which is not valid" (#18)

 * Fixed util.filetourl breakage on Windows. (#13)

 * Added XInclude support in rules file.

 * Empty links in the theme like <a href=""> both work now; in the last release Deliverance would
   throw an error when trying to parse these. (#31)

 * When fetching the content document, responses with Content-Length:0 will be passed through to
   the client. Previously these would cause an error. (#25)
